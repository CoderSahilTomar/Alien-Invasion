# Alien-Invasion
This is a project I made using python language in PyCharm.
This is the first project in the book Python Crash Course By Eric Matthes
(https://www.amazon.in/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1593279280)
Basically I just copied the code but I learnt very much about game development, PyGame module and Object Oriented Programming.
